Στη συνέχεια, ανάλογα με το σκορ που έχει σχηματιστεί για κάθε ταινία, θα επιλέγεται αν αυτή θα μπορούσε να είναι προτεινόμενη για τον χρήστη ή όχι και θα μετράμε το πόσο καλά τα πήγε το σύστήμά μας με βάση ορισμένες μετρικές.\n","\n","Η λογική πίσω από την παραπάνω διαδικασία είναι ότι παρόμοιες ταινίες θα έχουν ανάλογο βαθμό.

Η μετρική αυτή μας δίνει μια εικόνα σχετικά με τον αριθμό των ταινίων που προβλέψαμε ως προτεινόμενες ενώ δεν θα έπρεπε.\n","\n","2. Recall: Υπολογίζει πόσα από τα στιγμιότυπα που ανήκουν σε μια κλάση (π.χ. προτεινόμενες ταινίες) προβλέφθηκαν σωστά.\n","\n","3. F1: Είναι ένας μέσος μεταξύ των παραπάνω δυο μετρικών, έτσι ώστε να διατηρείται μια ισορροπία μεταξύ τους. Υπολογίζεται από την παρακάτω σχέση:\n","\n","$$F_1=2\\frac{Precision\\times{Recall}}{Precision+Recall}$$\n","\n","Οι παραπάνω συναρτήσεις παρέχονται από την βιβλιοθήκη scikit-learn.\n","\n","Τέλος για την καλύτερη επίβλεψη του συστήματος σας μπορείτε να εκπαιδεύσετε  τον recommender σας με ένα υποσύνολο ταινίων από ελάχιστες, λίγες μέχρι και πολλές (π.χ. 3, 5, 10, 50, ...) για να μελετήσετε κατά πόσο σας βοηθούν οι επιπλέον αξιολογήσεις κάθε φορά (δηλαδή κατά πόσο βελτιώνονται οι παραπάνω μετρικές στο test set). \n","\n","Έτσι π.χ. μπορείτε να εντοπίσετε περιπτώσεις όπως για παράδειγμα ότι με έναν recommender μπορεί να μην επιτυγχάνετε πολύ υψηλό σκορ όσο με άλλους, αλλά το βέλτιστο σκόρ σας επιτυγχάνεται πολύ γρηγόρα π.χ. με μόνο 10 ταινίες αντί 100. Έτσι για παράδειγμα αν ο αλγόριθμος τα πηγαίνει πολύ καλά για τρεις ταινίες και στη συνέχεια το σκορ βελτιώνεται ελάχιστα τότε αυτός ενδείκνυται για ένα σύστημα συστάσεων για νέους χρήστες όπου δεδομένου λίγων ταινιών ο αλγόριθμος είναι σε θέση να το να προτείνει καλές συστάσεις. Ενώ αν η καλύτερη απόδοση του αλγορίθμου σας είναι βέλτιστη με περισσότερες ταινίες π.χ. 50 τότε αυτός ο αλγόριθμος συστάσεων ενδείκνυται για παλιούς χρήστες με πολλές αξιολόγησεις.
